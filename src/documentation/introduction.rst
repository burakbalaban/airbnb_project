This file using multiple dataset containing Airbnb listings in Istanbul tries to examine and control change in Accommodation Services, a part of Inflation. As being the most populated city, Istanbul offers many accommodation options including Airbnb. The assumption is change in Accommodation services should reflect the change in Airbnb prices. Ultimately, this file produces two figures and a paper explaning those.

The figure making process is explained in :ref:`figure` section. Lastly, the output paper and presentation of our analysis is discoursed in :ref:`paper` section.
