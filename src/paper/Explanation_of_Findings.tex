\section{Main Findings}

The accounting method of Turkish inflation has been criticized
by the press and various academics for over a decade.
This paper intends to compare the change in Airbnb listing prices with
official inflation announcement for Istanbul.
Airbnb is a service that ables tenants to sub-rent their places for a fee,
in other words, one can rent his house like a hotel-owner.
The main assumption is, the change in prices of houses offered in Airbnb
website should coincide with the change in Accommodation Services prices
calculated by the Turkish Statistical Institute(TurkStat) \cite{TurkStat}.
The data for Airbnb listings is from April 2018 until December 2019.
May 2018 and June 2018 are missing. The Airbnb data is retrieved from
insideairbnb website and further information regarding
scraping methodology can be found on the insideairbnb website \cite{insideairbnb}.
The dataset includes the features of houses including the number of rooms, beds,
utilities offered, its location and many others.
The processing of included utilities and other explanations written by a house owner
requires Natural Language Processing which ignored by this paper, instead
the length of explanations are taken into consideration.
It is assumed that with more detailed explanation a house owner
tends to spend more time in drawing the attention of renters and
charge a higher price.

The location of a house is also a significator determinant in the price yet
only a score given by previous customers is available in the aformentioned
dataset. Rather than relying solely on that score, using a dataset
popular venues are tried to be found and a location-based score
added to each house in the Airbnb dataset.
I try to filter only venues in Istanbul in the Global Scale Check-in dataset
which scraped from Foursquare by \cite{yang2016participatory}.
Foursquare is a smartphone application that users can share their
current visit to venues.
After counting check-ins in those venues and dividing that count with
the distance between a house and venues within 1 km,
a location-based score is calculated and added to the analysis.

Using a certain amount of the features in the Airbnb dataset,
a set of houses generated randomly and prices for those houses
tried to be predicted by using Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm.
For each Airbnb dataset, a model is trained and based on the given
information model predicts prices for generated data.
The change in the means of those predictions is the interest.

    \label{fig:monthly}
\end{figure}
\autoref{fig:monthly} shows the monthly change in predicted prices
denoted as Analysis(Airbnb) and
official statistics calculated by TurkStat.
Predicted price change follows a pattern around the official statistic
which may stem from seasonality.

    \caption{Percentage Price Change Compared the Last Year's Same Month}
    \label{fig:yearly}
\end{figure}


\autoref{fig:yearly} displays the yearly percentage change in predictions
alongside with official statistics.
Since there is not available data for May and June 2018,
in analysis those observations are missing.
In \autoref{fig:yearly}, our predictions displays
rather odd pattern compared to official statistics.
Therefore, Airbnb prices may not be a significant indicator
of Accommodation Services prices in Istanbul.
